# MoeShop
This is the last project for the Knowledge Academy frontend course. In this project, I worked on an e-commerce website. The backend I used was developed by Eng. Tariq Shreem, the instructor of the course.

## Prject Description
- In this project, I handled the login and registration processes, including form validation.
- Guest users can review the categories and products but can't access the cart or orders views, and they can't add elements to the cart. Only authorized users are allowed to do so.
- Users can filter the product list by price, and they can sort products based on price or discount in an ascending or decending order.
- Authorized users can access their profile details, add products to their cart, and manage the cart by removing products from it or changing the quantity.
- They also can rate the products they ordered and add commets to them.

## Technologies used in the project
- ReactJS.
- Tailwind CSS.
- Framer motion.
- Formik and yup.
